## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Creating the layout of the card was quickly finished.
The bigist problem was the hover effect over the top picture. i was over thinking it too much. the problem was the opaccity on the eye img was either transparrent or not visa verca cyan background overlay

the solution is to give the image 1 opaccity and the overlay backround color you have to assigne a rgba value with alphachannel lowered

creating the hover effect in html and css:

- div container
- div img div
- div overlay
- img
- div
- div
